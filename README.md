Tampon Run Remix
================

Tampon Run remade for Android devices with some improvements.
The original HTML5 game by Andy & Sophie was released with no license so i have
decided to completely reprogram it in BennuGD.
Because they already made an HTM5 version , 
i have decided to do it for Android devices instead.

It's available on the Google Play , Amazon Appstore and AndroidPIT.

I'm working on a OUYA version as well and (i hope) it will be available soon.
