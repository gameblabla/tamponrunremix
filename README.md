Tampon Run Remix
================
I'm no longer working on it because the makers of the original game (Andy & sophie)
decided that copyrights were more important than feminism or spreading the word about it 
and  they sent me a DMCA notice.

The problem is that i used some non-free assets but the code (made in BennuGD , unlike the real game coded in javascript)
itself is still free as i have used no code from their game.
